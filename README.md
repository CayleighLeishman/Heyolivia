This repository contains my personal React project where I built a chatbot interface.  
The app is designed to send comforting messages, funny reminders, and pictures to a friend based on the messages they send.  

## Features
- Sends random funny or heartwarming messages
- Responds with comfort messages when the user feels sad
- Sends “I miss you” messages when the user expresses missing you
- Shares pictures based on categories like “animal,” “fun,” “temple,” and “me”
- User-friendly chat interface built with React

## Letter to a Friend

Hi Olivia!,

I'm thankful for our time at BYUI. I miss you a lot—especially when you came with me to the exercise gym, helped me socialize, guided me toward opportunities that moved me closer to working a job, and worked with me at my apartment during study sessions for my assignments.

I loved our time together and will miss it, but I'm glad we got to be friends during that period.

With Lots of Love,  

Cayleigh Leishman
